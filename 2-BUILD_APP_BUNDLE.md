# Build Application executables

This guide covers installing `plutus-chain-index`, `cardano-wallet`, and `pab-game` into `$HOME/.cabal/bin`

- Build and install the executables. The executables will be symbolically linked from your `$HOME\.cabal\bin` directory
  ```shell
  cabal install plutus-chain-index cardano-wallet pab-game
  ```
- Verify the versions of the executables
  ```shell
  
  ```
